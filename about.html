                <h2 class="story-title">Our Beginning</h2>
                <div class="story-text">
                    <p>Repz Your Style was born in 2019 from a small but passionate team who lived and breathed street dance culture. What started as a simple dream — to unite dancers from around the world and celebrate their unique styles — quickly became a platform for creativity and community.</p>
                    <p>From the very start, we wanted Repz Your Style to be more than just another dance battle. That's why the first edition in 2019 included not only street dance battles but also a K-Pop dance cover competition, opening the stage to more dancers, more diversity, and more energy.</p>

                <div class="story-text">
                    <p>Just as momentum began building, the world was hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Like many others, we had to put everything on hold. No events, no gatherings, no chance to bring people together. It was a difficult time — but we never gave up on our vision.</p>

                <div class="story-text">
                    <p>In 2023, Repz Your Style 2023 made its long-awaited return — bigger, better, and more exciting than ever. With the theme
                    “More Activities, More Experiences, More Fun,” we expanded beyond dance into a full cultural experience.
                    That year, our event featured:
                    Street dance battles & K-Pop dance covers
                    Art exhibitions & creative workshops
                    A vibrant local bazaar with over 80 handicraft & food vendors
                    Repz Your Style 2023 became a milestone, made possible by the overwhelming support of dancers, artists, vendors, and our
                    community.
